# Tactics Arena

Put your tactics to the test against other players in a 1v1, chess-like arena!

### Quick Start

To get a local instance of the game up-and-running, run the following commands.

```bash
npm install
npm run assets:build
npm run start
```

This will install all the game dependencies, build the assets and server, then serve the game.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the game.

### Contributing

You won't want to keep running the commands to manually build the assets and server, so run 
the following commands to set listeners for changes on the assets and server files.

```bash
npm run assets:watch
npm run server:watch
```
